# neurontainer

`neurontainer` (pronounced neuron-tainer, all lowercase) is a Neuro integration that allows Neuro to communicate and control the Docker daemon, via the Docker Engine API.

This is the "TypeScript Docker Desktop extension" version of the codebase, codenamed `noderontainer`. It is also sometimes called `neurontainer.ts`.
The older (and unreleased) Python app version of neurontainer will be referred to as `pyrontainer`/`neurontainer.py`.
